<h1 align="center">About Us</h1>
<br> <br> 
<p>
we have so many varieties of burgers, actually burgers are called as "HAMBURGER".
A hamburger (also burger for short)  is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked 
patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. 
the patty may be pan fried, grilled, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; conndiments 
such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sause",often a variation 
of thousand island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns.
A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheese burger.

The term "burger" can also be applied to the meat pattyon its own,especially in the 
United kingdom, where the term "patty" is rarely used, or the term can even refer 
simply to ground beef . Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity 
"burger" may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef 
burger, turkey burger, bison burger, or veggie burger. these burgers are sold at
our restaurent.

<p>

Raw hamburger may contain harmful bacteria that can produce food-borne illness such 
as Escherichiua coli 0157:h7, due to the occasional initial improper preparation of 
the meat, so caution is needed during handling and cooking . because of the potential
for food-borne illness, the USDA recommends hamburgers be cooked to an internal
temperature of 160 degree F heat(71 degree C). if cooked to this temperature, they
are considered well-done. so, that we done our burgers in very safety and organised.
we do our burgers safe and secure . burgers are actually originals from united states, Germany.
